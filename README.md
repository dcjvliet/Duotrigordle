# Duotrigordle
Practice software for duotrigordle

This is a software that I made to practice when going for the Duotrigordle world record. I made it with my use in mind, so it might not be the most user friendly, but it's not too complicated and is fairly self explanatory. Downloading it and running it is going to 
be the most complicated part. It is still a work in progress, and there are a couple things I would like to add to it still. All code will be open source. If you would like to report a bug, suggest a feature, or possibly want to help with the coding/graphic design,
feel free to email me at minestone4306@gmail.com or dm me on discord at minestone4306. I hope you enjoy and download instructions will be below.

**DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Install python. This can be done by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and downloading the version that works for your computer. This was coded exclusively on Python 3.9.9 and I have not tested it on other versions. Must be run on Windows 7 and up.

2. Click on whichever link is for your operating system, and download the installer to your desktop (should be the default location).
3. After you have clicked install, run the installer from your desktop.
4. **MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE BOX THAT SAYS "Add python.exe to PATH"**
5. Simply click install and if it asks for admin permission, just say yes. Here is a video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yivyNCtVVDk (He adds python to all users, you can do this if you want).
6. You can delete the installer now if you would like.
7. Now you need to install a IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are two main options for Python and I'll explain both.                      
   a) Download and use Visual Studio Code. This is what I would recommend. It is quite simple to install and use. If you don't already have it installed (some computers will have it preinstalled) go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the version that is for your computer (if you're on windows just click the big button up top, I'm not familiar with Mac and Linux). Just save the installer to your desktop again. Run the installer, accept the terms of service, and just keep clicking next until you see install. Once it is done installing, you can delete the installer and close Visual Studio for now. I would recommend restarting your computer after this, but it may not be required.
   
   b) The second and slightly harder way is by using PyCharm. PyCharm is similar to Visual Studio, but intended specifically for Python. To download it, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC and download the installer to your desktop. I don't know if they support operating systems other than Windows. Run the installer from your desktop. Click next once, and then again. **ON THE NEXT SCEREN MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE BOX THAT SAYS "Add launchers dir to the PATH"** Click next, and then click install. You can choose to reboot after installing, as it will be required. Once you have clicked finish, you can delete the installer and close out PyCharm if it opens.
8. Now you need to download the files for the actual program.
