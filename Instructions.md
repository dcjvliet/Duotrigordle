This file will contain information on every aspect of the game and how to use it.


**QUIT AND SETTINGS**
Quit will quit the game surprisingly. Settings is where you can set your keybind for resetting and what IDE the program is being run on. To change it simply click on the box and press the key you want reset to be bound to, then press enter. **DO NOT SET THIS TO A LETTER**. If you do, it will reset while you are typing words during the practices. I would recommend setting it to a key near the letters on your keyboard, but not too close that you accidentally press it. **MAKE SURE YOU SET THE IDE** because if you don't, the Top Times function will not work, and possibly other features in the future.

**RECOGNITION PRACTICE**
Recognition practice is very important when it comes to Duotrigordle. This is designed to improve how quickly you can recognize words given some starting words. When you click on it, it will ask for the number of starting words. This can range from 1-5. After this it will ask for your starting words. These are the words that will help you recognize the words. For speedrunning, most people use 4 or 5 starting words. Anymore than 5, and it won't be possible to finish the Duotrigordle. I would recommend using words that have unique letters. The combination that I use is **glent, brick, jumpy, waqfs, and vozhd**. There are many other combinations, and find the one that best suites you. Once you have inputted a word, it will tell you whether you are right or wrong, and you can reset to try another word. For each word a time will be stored in "recognition_top_times" that symbolizes the fastest you have ever recognized that word. If there is no time, it means you have not gotten that word yet. 

**LATE GAME RECOGNITION PRACTICE**
This is what it sounds like. It is the exact same as recognition practice, just later in the game so there are more words guessed. **Still input the same starting words, the other words will be chosen at random**. There will be 11 guesses, and you have the same goal as recognition practice; figure out the word as fast as you can. For each word a time will be stored in "late_game_recognition_top_times" that symbolizes the fastest you have every recognized that word. If there is no time, it means you have not gotten that words yet.

**STARTING PRACTICE**
This is a practice designed to improve how fast you can type your starting words. Simply input the number of starting words and your starting words (must be 5 or less words), and then you can practice typing them. You can reset at any time by pressing your reset key, so if you mess up in the middle, just reset. All of your times will be saved in "starting_times". There will be no green and yellow letters for this as there is no answer, you are just practicing typing the same words, in the same order.

**TYPING ACCURACY PRACTICE**
This is a practice that is designed to increase your typing speed and accuracy in situations like Duotrigordle. Most of the time, you will have one word to type, and then you won't know the next word you are typing until you have finished the previous. This essentially is practicing your ability to type a random word that you haven't seen prior as fast and **as acurately** as possible. Accuracy will always be more important, as when speedrunning typing it slowly and correctly will be better than incorrectly and quick. Typing incorrect words will end up in failing the Duotrigordle, so typing accuracy is incredibly important.

**MULTITASKING PRACTICE**
This practice is a bit interesting. This is strictly for speedrunners who want to go very fast. When speedrunning, it is possible to recognize a word, start typing it, and while you are typing, begin figuring out the next word. That is the goal of this practice. There will be two Wordles at once. The goal is to figure out the first one, and then as you are typing, figure out the next one. Try to keep this chain going for as long as possible. Eventually you will hit words that you don't instantly recognize, so don't expect to be able to do this constantly. **This practice is hard** and I would recommend doing a lot of recognition practice beforehand.

**DISCLAIMER**
This is still a work in progress, and features are still being added or changed. It will not be bug free, as I did not rigorously test the software. If you found a bug, want to suggest a feature, or want to help with development/design feel free to email me at minestone4306gmail.com or dm me on discord at minestone4306. 

**FUTURE UPDATES**
A major update I have planned is a config file so that settings don't need to be inputted each time the program is run. This would make it much more user friendly. Possibly adding a live leaderboard for all players, so it is more competitive, although this would require some work.
